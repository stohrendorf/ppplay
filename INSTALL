These are build instructions for Linux. They're quite not perfect
and some things can be wrong. So if you consider a problem,
please contact me via e-mail: <steffen.ohrendorf@gmx.de>

== PREREQUISITES ==
 - boost libraries and headers (system, format, exception)
 - cmake 2.8+
 - SDL libraries and headers
 - gcc/g++ 4.8+
 - doxygen and graphviz if you want to build the docs

== CMAKE BUILD ==
 - 'cd' to the source root where ppplay.cpp is located
 - 'mkdir build'
 - 'cd build'
 - 'cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..'
 - 'make'
 - If you want to build the API docs: 'make docs'
 - and if you want to install the binaries: 'sudo make install'
