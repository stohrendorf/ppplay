* Review docs
  
  Relatively much information is outdated or simply wrong, much documentation is missing.
  Main focus is to check already existing doxygen docs and then start writing docs for undocumented entities.
  

* Thread safety
  
  There are many places where thread safety is missing or badly implemented.


* Parameters
  
  Check if basic types are marked as const when passed as parameters and remove the qualifier.
  Check if complex types can be passed as reference to const.
  
  
* Exceptions, errors
  
  Too many exceptions are catched and thrown, many are errors recoverable, that means they're not putting the program into an unstable state.


* XM

  Envelopes
  Vibrato
  Key off handling
  ...


* General module interface

  Add methods like "getNormalizedVolume" that return percentage values.
  Add factory methods for automatically registering supported module types.
  Move S3mModule/XmModule implementations into a private class -> pImpl.

* Audio system
  
  Add a "RawVector" template class that copies data without respect for constructors or copy operators; should speed up audio output.
  Add OGG support.

* Graphics system
  
  Add more widgets/screens (file browser, song message, additional meta information...).
