* Review docs
  
  Relatively much information is outdated or simply wrong, much documentation is missing.
  Main focus is to check already existing doxygen docs and then start writing docs for undocumented entities.
  

* Thread safety
  
  There are many places where thread safety is missing or badly implemented.


* Parameters
  
  Check if basic types are marked as const when passed as parameters and remove the qualifier.
  Check if complex types can be passed as reference to const.
  
  
* Exceptions, errors
  
  Too many exceptions are catched and thrown, many are errors recoverable, that means they're not putting the program into an unstable state.
