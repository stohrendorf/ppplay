* Review docs
  
  Relatively much information is outdated or simply wrong, much documentation is missing.
  Main focus is to check already existing doxygen docs and then start writing docs for undocumented entities.
  

* Thread safety
  
  There are many places where thread safety is missing or badly implemented.


* Exceptions, errors
  
  Too many exceptions are catched and thrown, many are errors recoverable, that means they're not putting the program into an unstable state.


* General module interface

  Add methods like "getNormalizedVolume" that return percentage values.
  Add factory methods for automatically registering supported module types. [parts done, needs registry]
  Move S3mModule/XmModule implementations into a private class -> pImpl.

* Audio system
  
  Add OGG support.

* Graphics system
  
  Add more widgets/screens (file browser, song message, additional meta information...).

* Logging

  Add boost::format
